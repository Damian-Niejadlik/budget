### GETTING STARTED
1. Checking Python version.
    - To be able to use this app you'll need to have Python installed, you can check whether you have it installed or
      not by typing in terminal:  
      `python3 --version`  
      or:  
      `python --version`
    - If you don't have Python installed you can go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download it.
      <br/><br/>

2. Creating Virtual Environment
    - To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a
      script with the directory path:  
      `python3 -m venv your-env`
    - Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.  
      `source your-env/bin/activate`
      <br/><br/>

3. Download
    - You need to clone repository to your local destination  
      `$ cd path/to/your/workspace`  
      `git clone https://github.com/henryy07/gomoku_v_0_2.git`
    - if you have established ssh connection to github you can use this link to clone repo:  
      `git clone git@github.com:henryy07/gomoku_v_0_2.git`
      <br/><br/>

4. Requirements
    - Once your virtual environment is activated and project is cloned you need to install requirements:
